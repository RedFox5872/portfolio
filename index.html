        <h3>Improving High-Volume Client Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            Faced with managing a high volume of daily client inquiries, I implemented 
            structured prioritization methods and standardized response organization. 
            This improved response consistency, reduced follow-up delays, and enhanced 
            overall workflow efficiency.
